# SellBazar

**SellBazar** is a frontend-only e-commerce website for selling electronic products, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**. Currently, it displays product listings, product details, and offers a responsive design. Backend features will be added later as I progress in learning the **MERN** stack.
