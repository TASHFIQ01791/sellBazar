**SellBazar**
SellBazar is a frontend-only e-commerce website for selling electronic products, built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Currently, it displays product listings, product details, and offers a responsive design. Backend features will be added later as I progress in learning the MERN stack.

**Features**
--> Product Listings: View available electronics with basic details.
--> Responsive Design: Optimized for all devices.
**Future Plans**
Add backend with MongoDB, Express, and Node.js for user accounts, product management, cart, and orders.
